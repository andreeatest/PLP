With promising results in mice, next steps for the researchers will involve testing human heart cells in vitro and conducting
physiological experiments in animals with more human-like hearts, such as pigs.
More than a potentially life-prolonging treatment itself, the researchers see this microRNA-gel approach as representing a new,
more direct avenue for precision regenerative medicine.
“We’re seeing a change in approaches for regenerative medicine, using alternatives to stem cell delivery,” Burdick said. “Here,
instead of introducing new cells that can have their own delivery challenges, we’re simply turning on repair mechanisms in cells
that survive injury in the heart and other tissues.”
This work was made possible by financial support from the American Heart Association through an established
 investigator award to Burdick and a predoctoral fellowship to Wang,
and the National Institutes of Health through grants F30 HL134255, UO1 HL100405 and U01 HL134745.
Jennifer J. Chung, Tao Wang, Ann C. Gaffey,Minmin Lu, Christina A. Cavanaugh,Su Zhou, Rahul Kanade and Pavan Atluri,
all of the Penn Medicine, also contributed to the study.
Provisional patents concerning the technology described in this work have been filed.
